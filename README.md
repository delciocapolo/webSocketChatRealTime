* Let's learn together about Websockets and Socket.IO, using JS/TS.
# Websockets

* WebSocket is a technology that allows bidirectional communication via full-duplex channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol socket. It is designed to run on browsers and servers.
* You can read more about this, in [writing WebSocket Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers)

## Socket.io

* Socket.IO is a library that enables *low-latency*, *bidirectional* and *event-based* communication between a client and a server.
* you can read more in, [Socket.IO' site](https://socket.io/docs/v4)
* socketio are used most for communication bidirectional in real time, in chats. But we can't use for all activities, there are particular usage scenarios.
